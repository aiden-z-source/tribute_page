**Objective:** Build a webpage that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.

**User Story #1:** My tribute page should have an element with a corresponding ```id="main"```, which contains all other elements.

**User Story #2:** I should see an element with a corresponding ```id="title"```, which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").

**User Story #3:** I should see a div element with a corresponding id="img-div".

**User Story #4:** Within the ```img-div``` element, I should see an ```img``` element with a corresponding ```id="image"```.

**User Story #5:** Within the ```img-div``` element, I should see an element with a corresponding ```id="img-caption"``` that contains textual content describing the image shown in ```img-div```.

**User Story #6:** I should see an element with a corresponding ```id="tribute-info"```, which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.

**User Story #7:** I should see an ```a``` element with a corresponding ```id="tribute-link"```, which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page.

**User Story #8:** The ```img``` element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.

**User Story #9:** The ```img``` element should be centered within its parent element.
